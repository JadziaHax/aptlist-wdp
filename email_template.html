        Hey Lisa,
        <br>
        <br>
        Thanks for coming out to another Family Friday night. We know engaging
        with your fellow A-Listers is a rewarding expereince, and we want to
        make sure nothing gets in the way of that. To that end, we would like
        to get your opinion on Pizza R Us, the restuarant you attended with
        <a href="mailto:rohit@mycompany.com">Rhoit</a> and
        <a href="mailto:maria@mycompany.com">Maria </a>. <!-- Linking to
                                                              emails here just
                                                              makes sense -->
        <br>
        <br>
        Cheers,
        <br>
        <br>
