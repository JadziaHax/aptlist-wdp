## Heading Determination Research Notes:
  - Most familiar with erb for templating. Will likely start by just writing an example email in HTML and will convert to template.
  - Email clients are quite disparate in what they support in terms of HTML and CSS (forget javascript).
  - Use tables to replicate a pseudo box-model with the finest control supported across the most email clients.
  - Find out what assets Apartment List currently uses in emails to see if any can be repurposed here.
  - Use e-mail marketing approachâ€”consistent with viewing employees served as customers.
  - litmus guides and peer-support forums, google gmail and analytics support docs, check codepen for email-specific code to learn and adapt.
