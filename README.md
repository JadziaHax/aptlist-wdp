# Apartment List Web Developer Prompt

## Heading Determination Research Notes:
  - Most familiar with erb for templating. Will likely start by just writing an example email in HTML and will convert to template.
  - Email clients are quite disparate in what they support in terms of HTML and CSS (forget javascript).
  - Use tables to replicate a pseudo box-model with the finest control supported across the most email clients.
  - Find out what assets Apartment List currently uses in emails to see if any can be repurposed here.
  - Use e-mail marketing approachâ€”consistent with viewing employees served as customers.
  - litmus guides and peer-support forums, google gmail and analytics support docs, check codepen for email-specific code to learn and adapt.

## Notes From First Pass at HTML & Thinking Ahead
  - Working without <p> tags and just using <br> to shape text allows for more fine control that is again most widely supported by email clients. Hopefully can use line-height in css (which I understand is best supported when used inline in email.
  - Make use of as much payload data in ways that make sense.
  - There was a header logo in Apartment List's current emails that was easily usable for our template.

  - Nesting tables is actually encouraged and works as a good way to get clickable rating system under the text of the email.
  - Most obvious way to make links trackable is to use Google Analytics.
