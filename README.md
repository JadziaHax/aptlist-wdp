# Family Friday Web Developer Prompt

### Experience

While I had experience in web development, this is my first experience with
email templating. I was not expecting the rules of thumb that I had learned in
developing for browsers to be throw out the window so quickly.

The first oddity was the encouragement to use inline styling. I learned that
inline styling is preferable because many email clients break classes and ids
making writing css selectors difficult. I have learned of a work-around for this
called attribute selectors, but even with those it is expected that the styles
would be embedded between ```<style></style>``` tags.
